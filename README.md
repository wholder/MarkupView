## MarkupView

I wrote `MarkupView` to give me a way to include nicely-formatted documentation in my Java apps by including files in the ["**MarkDown**"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format in the resource folder in a .jar file.  `MarkupView` makes use of a markdown to HTML converter called [**TxtMark**](https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark), which was written by Ren√© Jeschke.  My code adds to this the ability to load images and pages written in MarkDown from the resource folder and also follow links other MarkDown pages in the resource folder as well as links to external sites by invoking the default browser.  Files are displayed by means of a JTestEditor component using HTMLKit inside a JScrollPane.  A minimal set of CSS styles is also defined in the code to format the HTML output.  However, I've only implemented the formatting features I needed, so you may need to expand on this for your application.

You can try out the programjust by downloading the pre-built, executable JAR file in the [out/artifacts/MarkupView_jar](https://github.com/wholder/MarkupView/tree/master/out/artifacts/MarkupView_jar) folder.  This display some sample MarkDown text like that shown in the image above.

### Requirement

`MarkupView` requires Java 8 JRE or [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), or later to be installed.

## Credit and Thanks
This project would have been much harder and much less cool without help from the following open source projects, or freely available software.
- [TxtMark](https://github.com/scream3r/java-simple-serial-connector) is used as a speedy way to convert MarkDown to HTML.
- [IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (my favorite development environment for Java coding. Thanks JetBrains!)
