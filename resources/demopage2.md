# ATTiny10IDE (Now for Mac and Windows)
ATTiny10IDE is a simple, GNU-based IDE I wrote to simplify writing code for the ATTiny10 Series Microcontrollers using C. C++ or Assembly language.  It's a greatly expanded and updated version of a project I started back in 2014.  [See read this article for some additional details on how this project started](https://sites.google.com/site/wayneholder/attiny10-c-ide-and-improved-device-programmer).  

If you just want to try out the program, you don't need to download and compile the source code, as I try to maintain a pre-built, executable JAR file in the [out/artifacts/ATTiny10IDE_jar](https://github.com/wholder/ATTiny10IDE/tree/master/out/artifacts/ATTiny10IDE_jar) folder from which you can download and run ATTiny10IDE as long as you have Java installed on your system.  On a Mac, simply double click the ATTiny10IDE.jar file to run it once you've downloaded it, although you'll probably have to right click and select "Open" the  first time you run ATTiny10IDE due to the Mac OS X security check and the fact that I'm currently unable to digitally sign the JAR file.  You should also be able to double click and run using Windows, but some versions of Windows may require you to [enable this ability](https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/run-a-jar-file-on-windows/) first.  The current version does not run on Linux.
