ATTiny10IDE is a simple, GNU-based IDE I originally wrote to simplify writing code for the ATTiny10 Series Microcontrollers using C. C++ or Assembly language.  This new version is a greatly expanded and updated version I started working on in 2014.  [See this article for some additional details on how this project started](https://sites.google.com/site/wayneholder/attiny10-c-ide-and-improved-device-programmer).  For this new release, I've added support for the ATTiny25/45/85 and ATTiny24/44/84 series of microcontrollers, as well support for programming them using an ISCP Programmer.  And, there's also an experimental feature for automatic generation of function prototypes.

## Credit and Thanks
This project would have been much harder and much less cool without help from the following open source projects, or freely available software.
- [Java Simple Serial Connector 2.8.0](https://github.com/scream3r/java-simple-serial-connector) - JSSC is used to communicate with the Arduino-based programmer
- [JSyntaxPane](https://github.com/nordfalk/jsyntaxpane) - Now uses [CppSyntaxPane](https://github.com/wholder/CppSyntaxPane), which is based on JSyntaxPane.
- [IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (my favorite development environment for Java coding. Thanks JetBrains!)
- [ANTLR version 4.7.1](http://www.antlr.org) - ALTLRv4 was used to generate the parser for the new (experimental) automatic prototype type generation feature.
- [CPP14 Antlr Grammar](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/cpp/CPP14.g4) - CPP14 was used as the base, C++ grammer for the automatic prototype type generation feature.
