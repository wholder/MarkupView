## Note: This section in development
ATTiny10IDE supports coding for the ATTiny85 Series of Microcontrollers in C and C++ as well as assembly using the GNU AVR-C++ compiler to generate code.  The file extension you choose for your code file tells ATTiny10IDE how to process the code:

    .c   - Compile as C file using avr-gcc
    .cpp - Compile as C++ file using avr-g++
    .s   - Assemble using avr-as and link with avr-ld
    
So, this means you'll have to save your source file with the appropriate extension before you can compile, or assemble it.  In addition, you can also write [inline assembly code](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee281/projects/aut2002/yingzong-mouse/media/GCCAVRInlAsmCB.pdf) in a C/C++ (.c) file.  You'll find examples of these different approaches to writing code in the [GitHub examples folder](https://github.com/wholder/ATTiny10IDE/tree/master/examples).
## Introducing the ATTiny85 Series Microcontrollers
The ATTiny10 series microcontrollers include the following devices, all of which are available in 8-pin PDIP, SOIC and TSSOP packages 0â€“10 MHz @ 2.7-5.5V, 0-20 MHz @ 4.5-5.5V:

+ ATTiny25 - 2K bytes Flash, 128 bytes RAM, 128 bytes EEPROM
+ ATTiny45 - 4K bytes Flash, 256 bytes RAM, 256 bytes EEPROM
+ ATTiny85 - 8K bytes Flash, 512 bytes RAM, 512 bytes EEPROM

All devices in the ATTiny10 Series include two 8 bit timers (each with a prescaler and two PWM channels), a 4 channel, 10 bit ADC, a Programmable Watchdog Timer with Separate On-chip Oscillator, and an on-chip Analog Comparator.

## Programming ATTiny85 Chips

The ATTiny85 series chips are designed to be programmed using a 6-wire serial protocol called In-Circuit Serial Proogramming (ICSP, or ISP for short.)  The signal used to program the ATTiny85 are, as follows:

+ VCC (Power)
+ Gnd (Ground)
+ MISO (serial output from ATTiny85 and input to programmer)
+ MOSI (serial output from programmer and input to ATTiny85)
+ SCK (serial data clock)
+ RESET (Reset signal)


### AVRISP mkII
The standard way to program ATTiny85 series chips is to use an In-Circuit Serial Programmer, such as the AVRISP mkII, pictured below:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ATAVRISP2.jpg" width="700" height="527"></p>

The AVRISP mkII is now discontinued, but clones of the AVRISP mkII are available from various on-line sellers.  To use an AVRISP mkII, select it as your programmer in the "Settings->ISP Programmer" menu.  Internally, ATTiny10IDE then uses AVRDUDE to program your ATTiny85.  The following wiring diagam shows how to connect the 6 pins from the AVRISP mkII to your ATTiny85 chip:

### Arduino as ISP

Another way to program an ATTiny85 is to use an ATmega328P-based Arduino (Arduino UNO, for example) as a programmer by uploading a specisl Sketch called ArduinoISP, which is included under the "Files->Examples" menu:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ArduinoISP.png" width="585" height="269"></p>

After upoading the ArduinoISP sketch to your ATmega328P-based Arduino use the following wiring diagram to connect the Arduino to the ATTiny85:

<p align="center"><img src="images/ATTiny85-to-ArduinoISP.png" width="469" height="293"></p>

You can use the ArduinoiISP Sketch as a general-purpose ATTiny85 programmer to upload and program other code, like this:

 1. First "Quit" the Arduino IDE so ATTiny10IDE will have access to the Serial Port on the Arduino running the Sketch.
 2. Start ATTiny10IDE and set "**`Settings->Serial Port->Baud Rate`**" to 115200 and "**`Settings->Serial Port->Port`**" to select the Arduino running the Sketch.
 3. Open, or write the source code you want to compile and program into the ATtiny85.
 4. Select "**`Actions->Build`**" to compile. or assemble the code.
 5. Connect the Arduino to the ATTiny85 using the same connections shown above.
 6. If you've changed the fuse setting from the default settings using the **`#pragma`** **`lfuse`**, **`hfuse`** and/or **`efuse`** directives select "**`Actions->SPI Programmer->Program Fuses`**" to write the new fuse settings to the ATTiny85.  Note: fuse settings are not altered when you upload new program code, so you only need to use this command when you need to set new fuse values. 
 7. Select "**`Actions->TPI Programmer->Program Device`**" to upload and program the code into the ATtiny85.
